# etongue: Processing Data of Electronic Tongue to Identify Mineral and Lead
## What is Electronic Tongue?
Electronic tongue is a membrane-based sensor made with composition and recipe from some published paper. The sensor consists of 4 sets with each set supposed to sensitive to one specific taste. The tastes specified are umami, salty, bitterness, and sour. By adapting into this idea, the artificial tongue-based sensor can 'felt' the difference components in a solution. For this case, the substances to identify is mineral (Calsium, Potassium, Magnesium) and lead.
## Purpose and Expected Outputs
The purpose are to identify substances in the solution and compare supervised with unsupervised method (clustering). The expected outputs are 4 model class for each substance classification case or one model multi-class classification.
## Why its matter to identify mineral and lead in solution?
This initial idea is one small step towards bigger developed product of electronic tongue. By identifying mineral and lead in a conditioned solution, the tools can be more developed by trial into more realistic solution so it will help standardize mineral drinking water and detecting toxic lead in water.
## Step-to-Step
1. Data cleaning : relative value calculation
2. Data visualization
3. Training Scheme : ML with PCA and clustering
4. Evaluation
